# VibeLife: Evolutionary Life Simulator

## Overview
VibeLife is an immersive life simulation game where players can observe and influence the evolution of organisms in a dynamic ecosystem. Rather than categorizing creatures into rigid classifications like "plants" or "animals," VibeLife focuses on the development and inheritance of specific traits through a unique evolutionary system that combines randomness with behavior-based adaptation.

## Core Concepts

### Trait-Based Evolution
Organisms in VibeLife are defined by their traits rather than species classifications. Examples of traits include:

- **Motility**: The ability to move around the environment
- **Photosynthesis**: The ability to generate energy from light
- **Predation**: The ability to consume other organisms
- **Defense**: Mechanisms to avoid being consumed (shells, spines, etc.)
- **Sensory**: Abilities to detect food, predators, or environmental conditions
- **Reproduction**: Different methods of creating offspring
- **Metabolism**: How efficiently organisms process energy
- **Size**: Physical dimensions affecting various other traits
- **Lifespan**: How long organisms naturally live

### Adaptive Evolution Mechanics
Evolution in VibeLife is driven by a hybrid system:

1. **Behavior-Influenced Mutations**: An organism's actions during its lifetime influence the probability of specific mutations in its offspring. For example:
   - An organism that frequently consumes others has a higher chance of developing enhanced predatory traits (teeth, speed, etc.)
   - An organism that remains stationary in sunlight has an increased chance of developing photosynthetic capabilities
   - An organism that survives multiple predator encounters might develop better defensive traits

2. **Environmental Pressures**: The ecosystem itself shapes evolution through:
   - Resource availability affecting population sizes and competition
   - Climate conditions favoring certain traits
   - Predator-prey relationships creating evolutionary arms races

3. **Random Mutations**: A baseline of random genetic variation ensures diversity and unpredictable evolutionary paths

### Simulation Initialization
VibeLife simulations begin with a single, simple organism and rapidly simulate thousands of generations to develop a diverse ecosystem:

- **First Organism Design**: Players customize the traits of the initial organism that will become the common ancestor of all life in the simulation
- **Rapid Evolution Phase**: The system quickly simulates thousands of generations, allowing natural selection and mutation to create diverse species
- **Time-Lapse Visualization**: Players can watch the accelerated evolution process with visual representations of emerging traits and branching species
- **Intervention Points**: During rapid simulation, players can pause at interesting evolutionary moments to observe or influence development
- **Emergent Ecosystem**: This approach creates truly unique ecosystems each time, with all species sharing evolutionary history and relationships

This single-ancestor approach creates more scientifically accurate and emergent ecosystems, giving players deeper insight into evolutionary processes and more meaningful influence over the simulation's development.

### Player Interaction
Players can:

- **Organism Control**: Take direct control of any organism in the simulation at will
- **Guided Evolution**: Influence an organism's evolution by directing its behavior and activities
- **Ecosystem Manipulation**: Alter environmental conditions to create new evolutionary pressures
- **Observation**: Study the complex interactions between organisms and track evolutionary lineages

## Environmental Conditions

The world of VibeLife features diverse environmental factors that influence evolution and survival:

### Climate Zones
- **Temperate**: Balanced conditions with moderate resources and seasonal changes
- **Tropical**: Abundant resources but high competition and predation
- **Arctic/Desert**: Harsh conditions requiring specialized adaptations
- **Aquatic**: Water-based environments with unique challenges and opportunities
- **Volcanic**: Extreme conditions with specialized resource opportunities

### Environmental Factors
- **Temperature**: Affects metabolism, activity levels, and energy requirements
- **Light Levels**: Influences photosynthesis efficiency and visibility
- **Moisture**: Determines water availability and affects mobility
- **Terrain**: Varied landscapes (mountains, valleys, plains) affecting movement and shelter
- **Resource Distribution**: Patchy vs. uniform distribution of food and materials

### Dynamic Events
- **Weather Patterns**: Rain, drought, storms affecting resource availability
- **Natural Disasters**: Volcanic eruptions, floods, or meteor impacts creating evolutionary bottlenecks
- **Seasonal Changes**: Cyclical variations in conditions requiring adaptation or migration
- **Day/Night Cycles**: Different opportunities and threats based on time

### Resource Types
- **Organic Matter**: Dead organisms that can be consumed
- **Minerals**: Essential elements for specific biological functions
- **Light Energy**: Primary resource for photosynthetic organisms
- **Heat Sources**: Thermal vents or volcanic activity providing alternative energy
- **Shelter**: Protected areas reducing predation risk or environmental exposure

### Biomes
- **Forests**: Dense vegetation with vertical stratification
- **Grasslands**: Open areas with high visibility and movement potential
- **Wetlands**: Resource-rich transition zones between aquatic and terrestrial
- **Deep Water**: Low light conditions with pressure adaptations
- **Subterranean**: Cave systems with unique sensory challenges
